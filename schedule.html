  <h3>Project 0: Groundwork</h3>
  <h4>
    Authors are the ones who convey their thoughts and ideas through their work. Anyone can take on the role of an author as long as they wish to express their thoughts and can transform them into a shareable format.
    <br><br>
    Graphic design also involves an act of authorship. Whether it's branding, editorial work, web design, or any other branch of graphic design, we as graphic designers translate our thoughts into visual formats and communicate our message to the audience.
    <br><br>
    As part of the preparatory work for the following Projects 1, 2, and 3, we will establish the foundation to find your unique voice as an author and embody it to a visual format in Project 0.

  <h4>
    1. Put your work on the wall and provide an explanation of why you chose this direction. (* Do not reveal your keywords yet.)
    <br><br>
    2. While one person is presenting, the rest of the group will write down five keywords on sticky notes that come to mind when they see the graphics. 
    <br><br>
    3. When everyone is done, put the sticky notes on each class member's corresponding work. If you have any good ideas, insights, or references that come to mind, write them down together on the notes and share them.

  <h3>9/12: Group Discussion</h3>
  <h4>
    See if your keywords match the ones your peers have shared with you and have a group discussion about it. While discussing, consider the following:
    <br><br>
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>Is your intention well communicated through the visualization?</li>
      <li>How do you want to develop the visualization?</li>
      <li>How can you use your graphic for the actual projects? (e.g. background on a website, typography on a book cover, etc.)</li>
      <li>Did the keywords your peers gave you expand your ideas?</li>
      <li>Are there any new ideas you can take?</li>
      <li>Did your creation show your visual uniqueness as an author?</li>
      <li>How could you develop your originality to further emphasize your voice as an author?</li>
    </ul>
